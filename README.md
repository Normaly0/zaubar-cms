# :file_cabinet: Zaubar CMS

A Front End CMS build with React and the Directus API.

## :mag: About

This project is part of what I've been working on during my time at the AR tour company Zaubar.
It was tied to a bigger project that should have allowed users to easily create and manage the content of their AR tours.

This application was meant for easier content creation by the end-user, utilizing the Directus API to manage content, as well as handling log ins, access tokens and the updates of the refresh token.

## :clipboard: Ideas

- might come back to this project at some point to add more functionality to it


## :wrench: How To Run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Therefore make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

In the main directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

For more information check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/)!
